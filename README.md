# Machine-Learning-Deeplearning-For-Indentifying-Velocity-Models
Convolutional artificial neural network (CNN) have proven to be useful in areas such as pattern/image recognition and trend analysis but in more advance discipline like applied geophysics and acoustics, there is still a lot work to be done. In this research we are focused on a given seismic recording. The question is can a trained CNN predict the MEDIUM that the signal has propagated through it? Unlike the conventional inversion method based on physical models, the supervised deep-learning methods are based on large collected data training rather than prior-knowledge assumptions. One excellent reason why deep learning should be considered is because it can automatically extract multi-layer useful features without the need for human-curated activities. During the training stage more time is needed depending on the size of the data, and actual predictions take less time, with only few seconds needed. The goal of this research is to reduce computational time of geophysical inversions, learn from existing data instead of using physical models and formulas (Acoustic wave formula) and estimating velocity models using seismic data as inputs directly (the network needs to project seismic data from the data domain to the model domain).
